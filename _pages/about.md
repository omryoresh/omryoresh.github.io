I'm a first-year economics Ph.D. student at the London School of Economics, interested in political economy, labour, and public economics.

In my research, I focus on understanding the impact of identity and cultural norms on economic outcomes while revealing instances of discrimination and their underlying causes.

Feel free to explore my work and connect with me!
